## **Study Plan for Mastering SQL, JavaScript, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Streaming Call Technology (C/C++)**

## Goal
- **Objective**: Become proficient in SQL, JavaScript, Data Structures, and Algorithms, and build a web system using streaming call technology with C and C++ within 2 months.

## Daily Routine
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: 1h30m
- **Japanese Language Study**: 45m
- **Streaming Call Research & Development (C/C++)**: 1h
- **SQL & JavaScript**: 1h15m
- **Homework**: 1h30m

## Weekly Breakdown

### Monday to Saturday (Focused Learning):
1. **Data Structures & Algorithms (1h30m/day)**:
   - Solve 2-3 problems daily focusing on:
     - Sorting
     - Searching
     - Trees, Graphs
     - Dynamic Programming
   - **Problem Difficulty**: 
     - 3 Easy
     - 2 Medium
     - 1 Hard (if desired)
   - Mix theory with implementation.

2. **SQL (Mon-Wed) & JavaScript (Thu-Sat) (1h15m daily)**:
   - **SQL (Mon-Wed)**: Practice queries, joins, indexes, optimization.
   - **JavaScript (Thu-Sat)**: Focus on ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, and async programming.
   - **Saturday**: Build mini projects (e.g., database system for SQL or web apps for JavaScript).

3. **Streaming Call Research (1h daily)**:
   - Study WebRTC, RTP, or other streaming technologies.
   - Implement small prototypes in C and C++ for call handling.
   - Review open-source projects for insights into streaming frameworks.
      - Apache Kafka: https://kafka.apache.org -- https://github.com/apache/kafka
      - Apache Flink: https://flink.apache.org -- https://github.com/apache/flink
      - Apache Spark Streaming: https://spark.apache.org/streaming -- https://github.com/apache/spark 
      - Apache Storm: https://storm.apache.org -- https://github.com/apache/storm

4. **Homework (1h30m daily)**:
   - Practice coding exercises.
   - Review key concepts.
   - Finish pending tasks or refine mini projects.

5. **Japanese (45m daily)**:
   - Use language apps, flashcards (e.g., Anki).
   - Practice speaking and listening skills.

### Sunday (Review & Rest):
- **Morning**: Review concepts from data structures, SQL, and JavaScript for 1 hour.
- **Afternoon**: Spend 2 hours on homework, review, or catching up on projects.
- **Evening**: Light coding practice or rest.

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 2 months
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Month 1**: Basic to intermediate SQL, JavaScript, foundational data structures, and streaming call research.
  - **Month 2**: Advanced topics in SQL/JavaScript, complex data structures, algorithms, and building the streaming call web system.

## Conclusion
This plan aims to balance theory, practice, and project development with a steady daily workload. Each week builds on the last, leading to gradual mastery of each topic.
